# Automatic medical image segmentation with Unet and Unet++
This repository contains Unet and Unet++ Pytorch code implemented for BraTS-2020 and Placenta-UoN data-sets.

## UNet++: A Nested U-Net Architecture for Medical Image Segmentation
This is the implementation of Unet++ paper using pytorch. You can find the original paper at
